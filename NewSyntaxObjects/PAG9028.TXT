Posting purchase orders dynamically updates inventory levels so that you can minimize inventory costs and provide better customer service.

Purchase orders can be created automatically from PDF or image files from your vendors by using the Incoming Documents feature.;

Blanket orders often cover only one item with predetermined delivery dates. The main reason for using a blanket order rather than a purchase order is that quantities entered on a blanket order do not affect item availability and thus can be used as a worksheet for monitoring, forecasting, and planning purposes.;

Purchase credit memos can be created automatically from PDF or image files from your vendors by using the Incoming Documents feature. Note: If you have not yet paid for an erroneous purchase, you can simply cancel the posted purchase invoice to automatically revert the financial transaction.;
